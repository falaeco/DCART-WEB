The year-end show is an exciting opportunity to exhibit students' work, and this year COVID-19 prompted a unique challenge to finding an alternate platform to showcase the talent of Concordia's Design and Computation Arts students. Together, the organizers of in.finite have created a digital home for this incredible collection of artworks and experiences, that can be appreciated from anywhere. While we can’t replace the camaraderie of a physical exhibition, discovering the works virtually is a way to support and learn from a wide range of artists and designers, during a time when we could all use a little more connection.

In.finite is an exhibition that showcases the process, conception, and realization of a diverse skill set that lives within the Department of Design and Computation Arts of Concordia University. In.finite is a place where Design and Computation Arts come together to put forward their strongest work while revealing steps that are typically hidden—through exposing key moments of the creative process in the physical and virtual world.

This collection of work invites the creators and viewers to question what defines a finished work, and whether or not a project is ever truly finished. Unique in their own way, each work relates to this overarching question, and initiates a discourse surrounding the limitations placed on projects and the extent to which they can evolve in order to keep up with their surroundings. In.finite is a [virtual] exhibition that asks us to reimagine and iterate upon existing works, concepts, and ideas, as well as the roles designers and artists have in influencing what is to come.
